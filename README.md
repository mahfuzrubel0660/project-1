Project 1 - DevOps (Implementation)

Project 1: Implementation.
 Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with GitHub webhook integration for Deploying Docker application on EC2 instances using the declarative pipeline.
Follow the steps:
1.     First of all, go to AWS portal, and create a new instance. As,
·       Name: jenkins-server
·       AMI: ubuntu.
·       Instance type: t2.micro (free tier).
·       Key pair login: Create > docker.pem.
·       Allow HTTP.
·       Allow HTTPS.
(Download the .pem file.)
Click on Launch Instance.
 

2.     Now, connect to the EC2 instance that you have created. Copy the SSH from server:
 
 
3.     Go to the download folder, where the .pem file is placed and open the terminal in the same location, and paste the SSH.
 
4.     In the machine, run the command
“ssh-keygen”
This will generate public and private keys in the machine.
Id_rsa – Private Key.
Id_rsa.pub – Public Key.
 

5.     Now we will install Jenkins on the machine, by following this link  
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
This will automatically install java with Jenkins.
 
6.     Install Docker as well to the machine by running,
“Sudo apt-install docker.io”
 
7.     Now check if it got installed by running “jenkins --version” and “docker --version”
 

8.     Now, we will allow ports 8080 and 8001 for this machine from a security group. We can find the security group in the VM description. Now, here we need to allow “Inbound Rule” as below:
 
 
9.     Now, Copy the Public Ip of the machine and paste it to the browser to access the Jenkins portal. As,
“54.193.49.139:8080”
 
 
10.  We need an Administrator Password to unlock this. For that, go to the provided highlighted path in the upper screenshot.
“cat /var/lib/Jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword”
 
Paste this password in the “Administrator Password” Column.

11.  Now Click on, “Install Suggested Plugins”
 
 
12.  This will now install the suggested plugins. As
 
  
13.  Now, Jenkins will ask us to create the First Admin User.
 
 
14.  Add the fields accordingly.
 
 
15.  The Jenkins homepage will look like this,
 

16.  Now, we will create a CI/CD pipeline, which will fetch the code from GitHub. 

17.  From Jenkins Dashboard, Click on “New Item”.
 
 
18.  Now, Add name as
Name: todo-app
Project: Freestyle project
Click “Ok”.
 

19.  Here, we need to fill up the description.
 

20.  In Source Code Management, select Git and Add Repository URL and Credentials.
(If there is not any added credential, we need to add username and key as password)
 

21.  In Build Step, select Execute Shell and write following command to build docker image and from Docker image we will create a container.
 
 
On Buils steps:
Execute Shell?

docker build -t mahfuzrubel0660/app1 .
docker stop app1
docker rm app1
docker run --name app1 -p 8001:80 -d mahfuzrubel0660/app1

22.  Now, Click on build Now. And the build will be started, in the build history.
 
 
23.  In Output Console,
 
 
24.  After getting success, In the browser, search for
<public_ip_of_ec2:8001>
 
Now, our goal is,
·       Whenever the developer commits their code in GitHub, after every commit, it should reflect in the live web app.
·       For that, we will use “GitScm polling”.
·       Every time, a developer made a commit, a trigger will run automatically, which will rebuild the image and run a container on your behalf as a part of automation that will run the pipeline automatically.

25.  Now, configure the project again, and add
Build Trigger: GitHub hook trigger for GitScm polling.
Description: GitHub webhook integration
 

26.  We need to install the “Git Integration” plugin from Manage Jenkins, by following the path,
(Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Git Integration).
 
 
27.  Now, Goto GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key.
Add details as
Title: chetanrakhra@gmail.com
Key type: <public_key>
 
 
28.  To get the Public key, open the “id_rsa.pub” file and copy the content. (Public Key) 
Of the jenkin machine.
 

29.  Now, we need to go to GitHub and create a new SSH and GPG Key.
GitHub > Repo “react-django-demo-app” > Settings > Webhooks.
30.  Add the following details,
Payload URL: http://<public_ip_of_ec2>:8080/github-webhook/
Content Type: application/json
Which event would you like to trigger this webhook?
o  Just the push event.
Active: True
Click on “Add Webhook”.
 
 
31.  Now, Save the configured project.
32.  Do some changes in the code and push to GitHub, this will automatically run a pipeline, and the new code will be Live.


Git command:
git pull https://github.com/mahfuzrubel0660/project-1.git
